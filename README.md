# Thread Maker for 𝕏

## What?

This app lets you clip your posts (formerly tweets) to fit the 280 characters limit for free tier users on 𝕏 and build a thread.

## Why?

I made this to simplify posting on 𝕏.

Maybe you don't want to pay for a subscription.

Or maybe you are already paying but feel that smaller threaded posts are easier to read than one big chunk of text.

Whatever the case, this tool could help you.

## How?

Start typing your post in the text area, select if you want any separator (or trail) to indicate this is a thread. You can choose one from the predefined pool or add a custom one. Then click the "Thread 🧵" button.

In the output section you will see the original text splitted.

By clicking on a paragraph it will be copied to the clipboard. Just go to 𝕏 and paste the text to post it.

## Do I need to register?

No, you don't. This app will NEVER ask you for any 𝕏/Twitter credentials at all. It just splits and pre-format text, so you can copy and paste it wherever you need it.

I'm thinking of adding a feature to allow users to save past threads, but it's not coming out in the near future. Stay tuned for any updates ⭐

## Is it free?

Of course it is! But if you feel like a little more caffeine could help me make things faster, you can:
