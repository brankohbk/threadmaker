# 𝕏 Post Clipper

## What?

This app lets you clip your posts (formerly tweets) to fit in the 280 characters limit for free tier users on 𝕏.

## Why?

I made this to simplify posting on 𝕏.

Maybe you don't want to pay for a subscription.

Maybe you are already paying, but feel that smaller threaded posts are easier to read than one big chunk of text.

## How?

Start tiping your post in the text area, select if you want any separator to indicate this is a thread. You can choose one from the predefined pool or you can customize it.

## Official solution as for September 2023

## Do I need to register?

No, you don't. In fact, this app will NEVER ask you for any credentials at all. It just splits and preformat text, so you can copy and paste it wherever you need it.

## Is it free?

Of course it is! But if you feel like a little more caffeine could help me make things faster, feel free to:
